Reference case for clm5.0_FTWC of WinterCrops

This test case offers a streamlined approach to evaluating winter wheat development in a monoculture setting, based on the developments outlined in [Boas et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-573-2021). 

It simulates winter wheat growth in a generic setting from 2009 to 2020, making it adaptable to similar research scenarios. Surface characteristics for this test case were constructed using a standard soil composition profile, including percentages of sand, clay, and organic matter optimized for winter wheat simulations. Forcing data, collected hourly from 2009 to 2020, utilized meteorological information from nearby sources to ensure an accurate representation of the environmental conditions affecting crop development.

Winter wheat crop parameters in the parameter file `clm5_params.c171117__FruitTree_with_cv.nc` were refined through a combination of in-situ measurements, literature reviews, and model calibration efforts, aiming to provide a realistic depiction of the cropâ€™s physiological responses to varying environmental conditions.

Detailed descriptions of the model developments and the adjusted parameter sets used in this test case are thoroughly documented in [Boas et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-573-2021).
